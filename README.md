# Python-Part-2
The second week studied Else after For, Break, Continue, While, Conditional Expression after While, List Comprehension, Functions Upper(), Underscore, Function and return.

### Else after For
The else function after for is a search-first loop to give the program a way out when a search is not found.
Example :

### Functions Break
- The Break statement stops the loop then exits, followed by executing the statement after the looping block.
- If you have a nested loop, Break will stop the loop according to which level or loop it is in.
- However, if it is placed in the second-deepest loop for example, only that loop stops, not the main loop.
Example :

### Functions Continue
- The Continue statement will make the current iteration stop.
- It then continues to the next iteration.
- Ignore statements that are between Continue and the end of the looping block.
Example :

### Functions While
- While in Python is used to execute a statement as long as a given condition is met (True).
- The condition can be any expression, and note that True in Python includes all non-zero values.
- When the condition becomes False, the program will continue to the line after the statement block.
Example :

### Else after While
In the While statement, the Else statement block will always be executed when the condition in While becomes false.
Example :

- Making Functions While & Conditional (If, Elif, Else)

### List Comprehension
List Comprehension is a way to generate new lists based on existing lists or iterables. There are times when we need to create a new list from a previous list operation.
Example :

- Writing the other way :

### Functions upper()
Used to convert characters in strings into capital letters. Example :

### Python's Underscore
Used instead of "dummy" variables in both loops and assignment statements where a function returns multiple values and wants to ignore one or more of them. Example :

<img width="297" alt="image" src="https://github.com/galihaulia9/Python-Part-2/assets/125258524/d892df92-8671-4dae-a3a0-9d56562e7879">

### Function (Fungsi)
- In math, a function is a process that relates an input to an output.
- In Python, in addition to these relations, functions are also a way to organize code-with the ultimate goal of code (reusability).
- Conversely, functions only have one specific use but can be reused.
- Common functions are provided by Python.
- But we can always define our own functions.
Example :

<img width="319" alt="image" src="https://github.com/galihaulia9/Python-Part-2/assets/125258524/8a12dbee-24f5-44c7-8296-4d9793a237ac">

### Return
The return [expression] statement will make the program execution exit the current function, while returning a specific value.
- The return value of a function can be stored in a variable.
- This will distinguish a function that returns a value from a function that does not return a value (often referred to as a procedure).
Example:
